## THE JAVASCRIPT BOOTCAMP COURSE

The document object is our entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains represenations of all the content on a page, plus tons of useful methods and properties.

it's all nested in a tree structure
document is our entry point that is why we use document. --> do something

console.dir(document). 

### SELECTING

what the DOM returns it looks like a HTML element, BUT it's not it's an OBJECT
set it to a variable and you can use the console.dir(object).
for example a image. then you will get an object returned. It's an object in the JS.


**types**
__proto___: HTMLImageElement
there are different categories of types like HTMLImageElement. because every element has their own properties for example a image has a src property while another element hasn't.
