# Array & Array Methods

###### what are arrays (recap)

The array object enables storing a collection of multipele items under a single variable name. In javascript arrays arent primitives. 

(what are primitives(datatypes again?)
In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:

*string
*number
*bigint
*boolean
*undefined
*symbol
*null )

- to get the last index of the array arrayName.length -1 




## Array Methods

array methods have callbacks 

the .filter() method --> filters some conditions if it's true you will get a new array. een filter functie moet altijd een boolean teruggeven.



It won't change the old array. good usecase when you for example want to filter 'the highest ranking things, old items, new items (like a year of the movie)



the .map() method --> allows you to take one arrays and converts it into a new array. it makes a new array for us. we map it to a new copied array. The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array. For example, consider the following array. 

.map() --> transformeer je een array van dingen naar iets anders. eerst 10 eitjes en na de map heb je 10 omeletten.




.filter()
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.
Filter let you provide a callback for every element and returns a filtered array.


While both the .filter() and .map() methods will return a new array, .filter() will create a new array of array elements that pass a given test while .map() will create a new array made up of the results of calling a function on each array element. 



the .find method  --> true or false .. return the first item that it finds in the array that is true.
it will not return a new array .

find method return the FIRST ITEM and won't give back a new array. The Filter method will return all items that are true to the condition. 






the .forEach() method --> looks like a for loop but takes a functions. it's the same as for .. of
for ... of is easier. 
The forEach method allows you to execute a function by iterating through each element of an array. It's important to note that the **forEach() method doesn't return anything**, and thus, if you try to get the return value of the forEach method, you will get undefined .



the .some method -- it just check if ONE ITEM in the array hold at least the condition TRUE OR FALSE. for example if there is a price below 50 dollars. if so than it will return 'true' if not then it would be 'false'


the .every() -- it just if every items in the array holds a certain condition. so if every item is for example below 100 dollars. if not that it returns 'false' if all items in the array are below 100 dollars then it will return 'true'


the .reduce method -- does an operation .. accumulating

the .includes() -- does it include a certain value? like 2? and you can also give a index number as parameter. 


## Array.sort()

sort die sorteert de elementen van een array en het gesorteerde array wordt teruggegeven het wordt dus ook op de plaatst gesorteerd en het word gereturned. 





## ARRAY METHODS: MUTABILITY

An important distinction between array methods is: "mutability" = veranderlijkheid. "Mutation" or mutation of an Array means: changing an array.

Depending on which array method you use, there are 2 options:

_Option 1_: the array method mutates the current array.
_Option 2_: The array method makes a copy and returns the modified copy. Leaves the original array unmodified.

Some array methods change the original array (and the items in the array). **Other methods make a copy of the original array, so they don't change the original!**

For example, the _.map()_ method makes a copy, iterates through all the items in the array, and returns a new array (so it doesn't mutate the original array). The _.push()_ method adds something to an array and **mutates** the original.

array methods that mutates are 
* .copyWithin()
* .fill()
* .pop()
* .push()
* .reverse()
* .shift()
* .unshift()
* .sort()
* .splice()

The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. To access part of an array without modifying it, see slice().


_syntax_ Array.splice(start, removeCount, newItem, newItem, newItem, ...)


**...arrayName1, ...arrayName2**
1.1 Merge using the spread operator
If you want to know one but a good way to merge arrays in JavaScript, then remember the merge using the spread operator.

Write inside the array literal two or more arrays prefixed with the spread operator ..., and JavaScript will create a new array with all these arrays merged:

###### Array.isArray()
syntax Array.isArray(value)
returns a boolean; true or false 




**reduce() method**




***return***
when you don't give a return type and you want to do something with it later on, it's not stored in memory anywhere, only stored locally in function. 


## Looping over arrays (iterating over an array)
