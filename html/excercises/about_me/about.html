    <h3>More about me...</h3>

    <p>
      name is Cilvya and today 20th may 2022 is the first day I started at WINC
      Academy. I always thought coding is something that is too difficult for me
      but anyone who has the will and mindset to learn can learn it! After a
      long time of working in marketing and having my own small business I am
      ready for a new adventure. I love the quote Niels shared during one of his
      lectures
