       <p>My name is Cilvya and today 20th may 2022 is the first day I started at
        WINC Academy. I always thought coding is something that is too difficult
        for me but anyone who has the will and mindset to learn can learn it!
        After a long time of working in marketing and having my own small
        business I am ready for a new adventure. I love the quote Niels shared
        during one of his lectures.</p>
