          <p>
            It is a large pigeon, measuring 40 cm (16 in) in length. The head is
            grey, like the upper neck plumage, which turns into green and copper
            hackles. The tail is very short and pure white. The rest of its
            plumage is metallic green. The cere of the dark bill forms a small
            blackish knob; the strong legs and feet are dull red. The irises are
            dark.[13]
          </p>
          <p>
            Females are slightly smaller than males; they have a smaller bill
            knob, shorter hackles and browner underparts. Immature birds have a
            black tail and lack almost all iridescence. There is hardly any
            variation across the birds' wide range. Even the Palau subspecies C.
            n. pelewensis has merely shorter neck hackles, but is otherwise
            almost identical. It is a very vocal species, giving a low-pitched
            repetitive call.

          <header><h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2></header>
          <p>
            The Nicobar pigeon's breeding range encompasses the Andaman and
            Nicobar Islands of India, the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar,
            offshore islands of south-western Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia,
            southern Cambodia and Vietnam, and many of the small islands between
            Sumatra, the Philippines and the Solomon Islands. On Palau, the only
            distinct subspecies C. n. pelewensis is found.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Nicobar pigeon roams in flocks from island to island, usually
            sleeping on offshore islets where no predators occur and spends the
            day in areas with better food availability, not shying away from
            areas inhabited by humans. Its food consists of seeds, fruit and
            buds, and it is attracted to areas where grain is available. A
            gizzard stone helps to grind up hard food items. Its flight is
            quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the
            wings, as is characteristic of pigeons in general. Unlike other
            pigeons, groups tend to fly in columns or single file, not in a
            loose flock. The white tail is prominent in flight when seen from
            behind and may serve as a sort of "taillight", keeping flocks
            together when crossing the sea at dawn or dusk. The young birds'
            lack of a white tail is a signal of their immaturity clearly visible
            to conspecifics to an adult Nicobar pigeon, it is obvious at a
            glance which flockmembers are neither potential mates, nor potential
            competitors for mates, nor old enough to safely guide a flock from
            one island to another

          <header><h2>Distribution and habitat</h2></header>
          <p>
            On the Nicobar Islands (which are referred to in its common and
            scientific names), the most significant colony of Nicobar pigeons in
            modern times was found on Batti Malv, a remote wildlife sanctuary
            between Car Nicobar and Teressa. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
            caused massive damage on the Nicobar Islands, and to what extent
            Batti Malv was affected is still not clear.
          </p>

          <p>
            But while everything on some islets in the Great Nicobar Biosphere
            Reserve was destroyed, Batti Malv lighthouse a skeletal tower a
            dozen metres high, standing a few metres ASL at the highest point of
            the low-lying island was little-damaged and put back in operation by
            the survey ship INS Sandhayak less than one month after the
            disaster. An April 2007 survey by the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS
            Vikram found the lighthouse tower "totally covered" in vines,
            indicating rampant regeneration of vegetation but perhaps also that
            damage to the island's forest was severe, as a cover of creeping
            plants is typical of early succession stages, while a photo of the
            lighthouse taken before the tsunami shows rather mature forest.
