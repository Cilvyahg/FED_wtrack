    <h1>Nicobar pigeon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It is a large pigeon, measuring 40 cm (16 in) in length. The head is grey,
      like the upper neck plumage, which turns into green and copper hackles.
      The tail is very short and pure white. The rest of its plumage is metallic
      green. The cere of the dark bill forms a small blackish knob; the strong
      legs and feet are dull red. The irises are dark.[13]
    </p>
    <p>
      Females are slightly smaller than males; they have a smaller bill knob,
      shorter hackles and browner underparts. Immature birds have a black tail
      and lack almost all iridescence. There is hardly any variation across the
      birds' wide range. Even the Palau subspecies C. n. pelewensis has merely
      shorter neck hackles, but is otherwise almost identical. It is a very
      vocal species, giving a low-pitched repetitive call.
    </p>

    <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
    <p>
      The Nicobar pigeon's breeding range encompasses the Andaman and Nicobar
      Islands of India, the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar, offshore islands of
      south-western Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, southern Cambodia and
      Vietnam, and many of the small islands between Sumatra, the Philippines
      and the Solomon Islands. On Palau, the only distinct subspecies C. n.
      pelewensis is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nicobar pigeon roams in flocks from island to island, usually sleeping
      on offshore islets where no predators occur and spends the day in areas
      with better food availability, not shying away from areas inhabited by
      humans. Its food consists of seeds, fruit and buds, and it is attracted to
      areas where grain is available. A gizzard stone helps to grind up hard
      food items. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional
      sharp flick of the wings, as is characteristic of pigeons in general.
      Unlike other pigeons, groups tend to fly in columns or single file, not in
      a loose flock. The white tail is prominent in flight when seen from behind
      and may serve as a sort of "taillight", keeping flocks together when
      crossing the sea at dawn or dusk. The young birds' lack of a white tail is
      a signal of their immaturity clearly visible to conspecifics to an adult
      Nicobar pigeon, it is obvious at a glance which flockmembers are neither
      potential mates, nor potential competitors for mates, nor old enough to
      safely guide a flock from one island to another
    </p>

    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
    <p>
      On the Nicobar Islands (which are referred to in its common and scientific
      names), the most significant colony of Nicobar pigeons in modern times was
      found on Batti Malv, a remote wildlife sanctuary between Car Nicobar and
      Teressa. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused massive damage on the
      Nicobar Islands, and to what extent Batti Malv was affected is still not
      clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      But while everything on some islets in the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve
      was destroyed, Batti Malv lighthouse – a skeletal tower a dozen metres
      high, standing a few metres ASL at the highest point of the low-lying
      island – was little-damaged and put back in operation by the survey ship
      INS Sandhayak less than one month after the disaster. An April 2007 survey
      by the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS Vikram found the lighthouse tower
      "totally covered" in vines, indicating rampant regeneration of vegetation
      but perhaps also that damage to the island's forest was severe, as a cover
      of creeping plants is typical of early succession stages, while a photo of
      the lighthouse taken before the tsunami shows rather mature forest.
