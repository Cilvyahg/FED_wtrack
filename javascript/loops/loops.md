# LOOPS

Loops are control structures/ control flows just like if else statement.

- automate repetitive tasks untill we tell it to stop

repeats parts of code for you so you dont have to repeat yourself.
it will check a certain condition for you and aslong that condition is valid it will keep iterating.

## While Loops

for the while loop we can only specify a conditon. 

it will run WHILE this condition is true;









***dictionary**
*iterate = herhalen

## For Loops

for statement
for loops has a counter.
for loops keeps running while the condition is true.

first part --> initialization the counter of the loop / so the starting point;
second part --> condition; will keep running if the condition still holds true.
third part --> counter ; rep = rep + 1 --> rep++ (same shorthand)
